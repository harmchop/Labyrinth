# Labyrinth

Generate mazes with different algorithms of arbitrary sizes. Solve your mazes and color the maze by distance from the start position.

Labyrinth can generate mazes using Binary Tree, Sidewinder, Aldous Broder, Wilson's, Hunt and Kill, Recursive Backtracking, and Prim's algorithms. It can solve mazes using Dijkstra's algorithm, DFS, and BFS.
